"""The input is a string str of digits. Cut the string into chunks of size sz (ignore the last chunk if its size is less than sz).

If a chunk represents an integer such as the sum of the cubes of its digits is divisible by 2, reverse it; 
otherwise rotate it to the left by one position. Put together these modified chunks and return the result as a string."""
