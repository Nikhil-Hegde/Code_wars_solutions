'''Tortoise racing'''

"""Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?"""
