"""Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. 
The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3."""
"""The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n."""
