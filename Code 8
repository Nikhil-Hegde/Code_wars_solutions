""" Sum all the numbers of the array except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
(The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)"""

'''Example:'''
'''{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6'''

'''Solution:'''

def sum_array(arr):
    if arr is None or len(arr) <= 1:
         return 0
    else:
         return sum(sorted(arr)[1:-1])
